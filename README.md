So as to comprehend and accomplish the snake 's movement and growth, you can refer to the following resources:
Snake Game Desk√âtape
- [How to Build a Snake Game in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-snake-game-in-javascript/) - This creates a beginner 's game from scratch, allowing you to understand the movement and growth mechanics of the snake.
- [Keyboard Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) - This is an extremely comprehensive account of the properties of keyboard events. When I was learning to guide the snake on its way with the guidance of user interaction this was very helpful.


# Game Obstacles: 
The tutorial on  ([Game Obstacles](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_obstacles.asp))was particularly enlightening. It explained how to create and manage obstacles within a game environment, adding an essential layer of challenge and excitement. The examples provided helped me visualize how obstacles could interact with the player and other game elements, allowing me to design levels that are not only fun but also strategically engaging.

 # [local storage ]
 MDN Web Docs - Using Local Storage - This documentation provided a clear explanation of how to use local storage, including examples of setting and getting items.
JavaScript Local Storage Tutorial - This tutorial gave me a practical overview of local storage, its benefits, and how to implement it effectively in web applications.



# Game Score Management
The tutorial on Game Score from W3Schools provided a clear and concise overview of how to implement scoring in games. It broke down the process into manageable steps and included practical examples that I could easily adapt for my project. Understanding how to effectively manage and display scores allowed me to create a more engaging experience for players, motivating them to improve their performance.

# Game Controllers
Another fantastic resource was the Game Controllers tutorial, which offered insights into how to handle user input effectively. This guide helped me understand the different types of game controllers and how to integrate them into my game. By applying the techniques outlined in this tutorial, I was able to enhance the responsiveness of my game, making it more enjoyable for users who prefer various input methods.


- [JavaScript for keyboard event track](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keyboard_events) - Reading through keyboard events was key in gleaning that the snake can be made to move according to user input.
- [Collision Detection in JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/series/javascript-collision-detection/) - This guide gave me the basics as to implement collision detection, so that we could determine when snake hits walls or itself.

- [snake layout] (https://playsnake.org/) I got my idea from this website of a snake game and it was very helpful.

# Starch Goals : 
A new band of sound effects could be created for things like nibbling on an apple ( Neither is bad ) and things like that. 
2. ** Difficulty Levels: Adjust the speed of the snake according to different difficulty levels. 
3. ** Mobile Optimized**: Currently there are no touch controls at all so one idea would see to develop them based on what is happening now wih the certain amount of success, for instance in modern handheld games that use screen tapping. ( by hitting red) 
4. ** Personalized Snake **: You could select a snake's color or appearance that fits your mood. 
5. ** Leaderboards **: Now you can compare your high scores with friends from around the world. 
8. ** Obstacles **: Add obstacles to the gaming field in this test version of things. 
9. ** Record Current Points **: At present, moving away from the game loses your current score; this ought to be changed9, record current points. 
10. ** Other Modes **: For example, a timed mode could be added so that players would have to hit a certain number of pieces in the available time.



### Research Progress
In the development of layout, I made thorough research to understand what set of different aspects were needed so as to create a real and fun game. I studied various articles, tutorials, and documents spent the countryside for insights into game mechanics, JavaScript programming languages and well-established facts. Not only did such a carry on to help me today with my coding skills, but it all reinforced my understanding of game design principles (in fact, today at work I couldn't manage without them!)
