- [How to Build a Snake Game in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-snake-game-in-javascript/) - This creates a beginner 's game from scratch, allowing you to understand the movement and growth mechanics of the snake.
- [Working with Arrays and Objects: JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects) - This guide taught me how arrays are used correctly, and array technique has become essential for keeping track of the position of the snake 's body.
- [The Game Loop: An In Depth Look](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/the-game-loop-an-in-depth-look--gamedev-1844) - This article opens a window on game loops, an essential aspect of which is to understand how clients can be used for rendering game state.
- [Keyboard Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) - This is an extremely comprehensive account of the properties of keyboard events. When I was learning to guide the snake on its way with the guidance of user interaction this was very helpful.
- [Collision Detection](https://www.sitepoint.com/collision-detection-javascript/) - This guide laid the framework for realistic collision detection, which is essential to determining when the snake hits the walls or itself.## 感谢
I want to sincerely thank the following resources that greatly helped me in understanding the mechanics behind the snake game and JavaScript game development:

- [Making Snake in JavaScript?](https://twilioresearch.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-snake/) - This was a very introductory article that went over the basic operations of our game, including movement and growth for snake.
- [JavaScript Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Indexed_Collections) - Ultimately, knowing how to wield the array was of utmost importance in keeping track of the snake's body segments.
- [Game Loop Understood](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-game-loop-in-game-development--gamedev-9602) - While I was at it, I got my first introduction to the game loop and learned the fine art of updating the game state and rendering.
- [JavaScript for keyboard event track](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keyboard_events) - Reading through keyboard events was key in gleaning that the snake can be made to move according to user input.
- [Collision Detection in JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/series/javascript-collision-detection/) - This guide gave me the basics as to implement collision detection, so that we could determine when snake hits walls or itself.

# Sound Effects : 
A new band of sound effects could be created for things like nibbling on an apple ( Neither is bad ) and things like that. 
2. ** Difficulty Levels: Adjust the speed of the snake according to different difficulty levels. 
3. ** Mobile Optimized**: Currently there are no touch controls at all so one idea would see to develop them based on what is happening now wih the certain amount of success, for instance in modern handheld games that use screen tapping. ( by hitting red) 
4. ** Personalized Snake **: You could select a snake's color or appearance that fits your mood. 
5. ** Leaderboards **: Now you can compare your high scores with friends from around the world. 
8. ** Obstacles **: Add obstacles to the gaming field in this test version of things. 
9. ** Record Current Points **: At present, moving away from the game loses your current score; this ought to be changed9, record current points. 
10. ** Other Modes **: For example, a timed mode could be added so that players would have to hit a certain number of pieces in the available time.



### Research Progress
In the development of layout, I made thorough research to understand what set of different aspects were needed so as to create a real and fun game. I studied various articles, tutorials, and documents spent the countryside for insights into game mechanics, JavaScript programming languages and well-established facts. Not only did such a carry on to help me today with my coding skills, but it all reinforced my understanding of game design principles (in fact, today at work I couldn't manage without them!)
